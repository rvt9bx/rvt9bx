## Projects
- **Gender Analysis and Link Prediction for Movie Co-acting Network**  
Built a large-scale movie co-acting network (37k+ nodes) from IMDB and TMDB data using **Python, NetworkX, igraph, and Node2Vec**. Applied community detection (K-Means, Louvain), centrality analysis, and t-SNE to study network structure and gender inequality. Trained link prediction and node-classification models in **scikit-learn**, showing that structural graph features strongly predict future collaborations, with gender providing secondary signal, and published results on an interactive **Quarto** website.

- **Global Statistical Analysis of Sentiment and Bias in News Media**  
Analyzed 4M+ global news headlines using **NLP, statistical inference, and time series modeling** to study sentiment and linguistic bias across countries. Collaborated with a team on Python and R workflows using HuggingFace datasets, VADER, and a DistilBERT-based bias classifier, combining large-scale **EDA, hypothesis testing, and ARIMA forecasting**. Used ACF/PACF diagnostics, stationarity tests, and model benchmarking to characterize how emotional tone and polarization vary across regions and news categories.

- **Thanksgiving 2024 Air Travel Analysis**  
  Developed a data pipeline for November 2024 U.S. DOT On-Time Performance data, building the schema with **AWS RDS and MySQL Workbench**, and loading large fact tables via mysqlimport through an **AWS EC2** instance. Published a data-driven website to showcasing insights and visualizations about Thanksgiving travel trends, including flight delays, cancellations, and activity patterns using **SQL, Python, Plotly, and Quarto**.

- **Wildfire Detection AI**  
  Led a team project to build an supervised predictive model to determine wildfire presence in images. Designed and trained a **convolutional neural network using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras** for image classification, achieving over 95% accuracy. Presented methodology, challenges, and results utilizing a **Canva slideshow** with **Matplotlib visualizations**.

- **US Voting Trends 2020 and 2024**  
  Developed interactive Shiny applications to explore the relationship between socioeconomic trends and election results in 2020, and compared Georgia's outcomes in 2020 vs 2024, using **R, ggplot2, and shiny**.
